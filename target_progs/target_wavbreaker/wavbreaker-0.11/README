   This application's purpose in life is to take a wave file and break it up
  into multiple wave files.  It makes a clean break at the correct position
  to burn the files to an audio cd without any dead air between the tracks. 
  It will only read wave files, so use an appropriate tool to convert ogg, 
  mp3, etc. files and then break them up.
  
   The gui displays a summary of the entire wave file being worked on at the 
  top. The middle portion displays a zoomed in view that allows you to select 
  where to start playing the track and where it will make the break when the 
  break button is clicked.  When a break is made, another entry will be added 
  to the bottom portion of the display.  This is where you may change file 
  names and select/unselect tracks that will be written when you click save.
  
   There is also a command line tool to merge wave files together, wavmerge. 
  So, if you download a show and don't like how it was tracked, you can merge 
  them together with wavmerge and then break them back up with wavbreaker. 
  This tool will only work on files that are alike.  For example, 44100 khz 
  sample rate, 16-bit sample size, etc.  I would suggest a tool named sox to 
  do any conversion you may need.
