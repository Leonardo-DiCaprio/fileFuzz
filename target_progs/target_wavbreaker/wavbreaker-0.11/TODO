[ ] Autosplit based on silence

Low Priority
-------------
[?] Movable Boundaries in wav display
[?] fix highlight on summary display
[?] sound card format issues
[ ] pause function
[ ] FLAC import/export functionality
[?] better track break txt offset file support
    - ask user if she wants to open a .txt offset file with the same name
    - save on exit
    - maybe write temporary track break backup in case wavbreaker crashes
[ ] Auto-Split dialog should have three spinners instead of a free-text entry
