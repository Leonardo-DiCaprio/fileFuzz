wav2cdr converts sound data into a format which can be recorded on a CD
(compact disc). The wav and a few raw formats can be handled (both read and
write). Input can be chopped into pieces, which can then be recorded as
separate tracks on CD. Some other transformations are also offered, e.g. volume
change.

Most of the functionality is also offered by sox, but when I tried it I only
got stupid messages about missing effects or some such (sox-11gamma-cb3,
command "sox -t raw -r 44100 -s -w -c 2 -V -x test.raw t"). Swapping the
argument order or reading the manual didn't help. Funnily enough, it didn't
complain on Solaris, but nevertheless I didn't want to trust it any more. (It
turned out not to work at all with GNU getopt() ). After a lot of tries with
different options and orders of options I gave up and decided it was faster to
make a quick thing myself. Hence wav2cdr, which by now is no longer a quick
thing.


SUPPORTED PLATFORMS
-------------------

All which have an ANSI C compiler, and some understanding of command lines. The
program adapts to both big and little endian machines automatically. Unless I
made a mistake, the source code is strictly ANSI conformant.

wav2cdr works on at least: Linux, Solaris, Dec Alpha Unix (was this Linux?),
MSDos.

If your system is neither Unix nor MSDOS/Borland C, check the name of your bit
bucket file in open_message_file(). If necessary, enter another conditional and
the correct name, *and* let me know about it so that I can incorporate it.

There is a Makefile for Unix and MSDos (the latter slightly restricted because
of limitations of Borland make).


INSTALLATION
------------

1)
    Some version of GNU getopt() is needed, or the (inferior) mygetopt()
    shipped with wav2cdr can be used instead. The former is now the default. To
    use GNU getopt, get the following files:

            28711 Jan 25  1997 getopt.c
             4691 Jan 25  1997 getopt.h
             4651 Jan 25  1997 getopt1.c

    from somwhere, e.g. tar-1.12.tar.gz, and copy them into the wav2cdr
    directory (or rather the directory specified in the Makefile). These files
    should also be part of many other GNU programs (not to say all?).

    
2)
    Edit the Makefile for your system, compiler, and getopt() version used.
    There are examples at the beginning of the file.

    The provided Makefile should work for most Unix systems with gcc. To some
    extent it might also work for MSDos. It works with GNU make and Sun/Solaris
    make. (Use the file Makefile.bc for MSDos instead.)

    The settings to check are mainly where the executable and man page is
    installed.

    If you do make any changes, please send them back to me.

3)
    Compile with:
        make depend
        make

4)
    Install with (not MSDos):
        make install
        
    Or copy the executable and man page into place by hand.

5)
    If you get sick ot it (hey!), wav2cdr can be uninstalled with (not msdos):
        make uninstall

The files

    usage.-c, help.-c, version.-c, wav2cdr.txt

are automatically generated using the programs awk/nawk/gawk, nroff, troff, cx.
These programs are typically found on a Unix system. cx is self-baked and
strips BS characters together with the following character (this gets rid of
the underline effect in output produced by man).
If you don't have these programs or some equivalent, don't delete these files.


DOCUMENTATION
-------------

The file help.txt, or running wav2cdr with option --help.

The Unix style man page (roff format), or its plain text equivalent
wav2cdr.txt.
