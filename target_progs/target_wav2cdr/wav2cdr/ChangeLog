2.3.4	18 Jan 2006

*)	Fixed some compiler warnings with gcc 4.0.2.
*)	Fixed type size problem on AMD64.
*)	Changed default Makefile from Makefile.orig to Makefile.gmake.
*)	Minor Makefile.gmake changes (not user visible).
*)	Compiling with -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 fails because the mechanism barfs too
	much on legal C constructions. Reduce to -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=1.
*)	New .spec file.
*)	Changed email address to @gmx.de.

2.3.3	27 Oct 2000

*)	Fixed error with the display of times in some places.
*)	The default is now to compile with GNU getopt() in the C library.

2.3.2	22 Aug 1999

*)	get_num_unit() now also accepts fractions for unit s. For all units, the
	result is rounded to the nearest CD sector boundary.

2.3.1, 18 Aug 1999

*)	Fixed error msg about --fadeout wenn there is no fading out.

2.3, 19 Jul 1999

*)	Added --fadein, --fadeout.
	Improved documentation in some places.

2.2.2, 7 Jun 1999

*)	Removed the heaps of silence values which were always printed with
	--silencecuts, rendering that option useless. Now they are only printed
	with --verbose. Documentation updated accordingly.
*)	Added 00:00.00 display to "Add silence" in the command argument output.
*)	For --silencethreshold = 0, the sector is considered to be silent if all
	samples are silent.

2.2.1, 3 May 1999

*)	For a last cut number of 0, the file size is displayed if available.
	Before the maximum possible file size (about 405 min) was always
	displayed.
*)	A few minor additions to the man page (and --help).
*)	Updated output of --help.
*)	Fixed bug in Makefile that version.-c wasn't packed up.

2.2, 04 + 21 Feb 1999

*)	Added __alpha in chelp.h to ensure proper definition for UINTxx and
	SINTxx when compiling on alphas.
*)	Added --version, -V.
*)	Added --verbose. With --silenceinfo it outputs the silence values of
	each CD sector.

2.1.2, 03 Feb 1999

*)	Fixed bug in display of times (the fraction of the second was
	incorrectly calculated).
*)	Added --inwav, --tocdr

2.1, 03 May 1998

*)	Removed long options --if, --of to make better use of GNU getopt()'s
	abbreviation capabilities. Added -r, -w instead.
*)	Added a few more values to be shown in some places. timeprintf().
*)	Warning message when a scale factor is negative.
*)	Fixed --silencecuts not working in some cases. process_silencecuts() is
	rewritten and (hopefully) is less spaghetti-like. Conditional
	HARDON_CUTS makes the delay-period (--silencedelay) be counted into the
	silent interval. I might make that a cmd line switch, but am not sure
	whether it is useful.
*)	Various methods of deciding whether a sector is silent were tried; I
	have a suspicion that there may be cases where none of them work. The
	most likely candidate is in use at the moment.
*)	Added function --silenceinfo.
*)	Added option --quiet.

2.0, 27 Mar 1998

*)	Added silence detection.
*)	Corrected byte ordering problem for operations other than scaling,
	when the byte order of the local machine was not the same as the byte
	order of the output format.
*)	Corrected example in man page.
*)	Added an indication to the usage showing whether wav2cdr was compiled
	with mygetopt() or GNU getopt().
*)	Took out long options --swch and --noswch to make things friendlier for
	GNU getopt().
*)	Fixed all places where a 32 bit is required not to use int or size_t.
*)	Needed to pull a few tricks for stupid Borland C. Use -DMSDOS_BC!


1.9, 20 Jan 1998	

*)	Fixed endian problem in write_wav_header().
	Thanks to [rick@dgii.com (Rick Richardson)] for noting this.
