This release (0.9) consists of the following tools:

oggJoin, oggSplit, oggCut, oggCat, oggTranscode, oggSlideshow, oggThumb, oggLength,
oggScroll, oggDump, oggSilence

Required Software
-----------------

you globally need c++11 + boost (at least lexical_cast and circular_buffer,
which are both header only) so if built, no boost libraries are needed.
Version is tested against boost 1.54, however earlier version may work as
well. 

for oggCat oggCut oggDump oggSplit oggJoin oggLength:
(No you do not need any ogg/theora/vorbis library for that)

for oggSlideshow, oggThumb, oggResize, oggSilence:
libogg
libtheora (>= 1.0)
libvorbis (>= 1.2.3)
 -> can both be found here: http://www.xiph.org/downloads/
libgd -> can be found here: http://www.libgd.org/Downloads/
