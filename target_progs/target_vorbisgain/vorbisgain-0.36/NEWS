VorbisGain 0.36

- added --no-progress option (Felix Berger)

VorbisGain 0.35

- no longer removes invalid tags
- now updates the progress bar once per second (but 0% and 100% are 
  always shown)
- truncates the filename in the progress bar so that it fits within the
  console width (try the configure option --disable-winsize if you have
  problem compiling on your OS)
- misc configure script fixes (e.g., use any Ogg Vorbis prefixes when
  checking for the ov_read_float() function)

VorbisGain 0.34

- fix automake bug
- update to new vcedit to solve various problems
  such as memory leaks

VorbisGain 0.33

- fixed a bug in the ReplayGain analysis reference code that could
  cause random crashes on 48kHz files

VorbisGain 0.31

- more changes to the pattern matcher. Should work fine now
- when using --album-gain, --fast wasn't handled properly
- more cleanups
- note: Winamp plugin in_vorbis.dll dated June 22, 2002 is known to support
  the new tag format

VorbisGain 0.30

- now tries to retain file mode and date when writing the tags
- added a simple, per-file progress meter
- more code cleanups
- better code page support on Win32
- updated to newer version of vcedit.c
- due to vocal complaints, the --recursive option is only included if
  DO_RECURSIVE is defined. It's recommended to define it on Win32 and not on
  any other platform. But in the end, it's up to whoever compiles VorbisGain :)
- new pattern matcher that accepts '\' as escape character (not needed on
  Win32)
- writes "new style tags" (and removes old style tags)
- --convert option to convert old style tags to new. The tags are changed
  as follows:

  Tag:                  Renamed to:
  RG_RADIO_GAIN         REPLAYGAIN_TRACK_GAIN
  RG_RADIO_PEAK         REPLAYGAIN_TRACK_PEAK
  RG_AUDIOPHILE_GAIN    REPLAYGAIN_ALBUM_GAIN
                        REPLAYGAIN_ALBUM_PEAK

  REPLAYGAIN_ALBUM_PEAK is new and contains the highest REPLAYGAIN_TRACK_PEAK
  within an album.
