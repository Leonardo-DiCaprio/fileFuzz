To do for version 1.0

- creation of a library, that is used by all command line tools
- Version 0.8 is the last version, that adds new command line tools
  ( this is the plan ;-) ), so the rest until version 1.0 were
  enhancements:
  - offset addition for streams in oggCut. This is not supported by
    many players, but may be important in future e.g. for kate streams
  - enhancements for several computations in videoFormats.cpp
    for a faster picture resize, import etc.   --- DONE ---
- reencoding of vorbis streams with oggResize --- DONE ---

Specialy for version 0.9
- correct handling of the aspect ratio in the theora header
  (oggResize and oggThumb) 
- identical comment handling for all tools
- vorbis end marker with correct sample number
- handling corrupt stream (resyncing on start or after gaps)

Plans beyond 1.0:
- Ogg Skeleton support

... many more to do! If you have any ideas, or want to help, please

0.8:
- new stream ID for vorbis in oggResize
